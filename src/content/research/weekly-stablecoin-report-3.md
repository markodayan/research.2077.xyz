Hey hey stablecoinjoyers! Here is a quick update: from now on I am not using screenshots taken from DefiLlama for graphs. Even though the main source is still DefiLlama, I will create my own graphs with the data retrieved by DefiLlama API. I hope you enjoy this improvement. Let's begin the third post of our weekly stablecoin reports. In this report, you will find:

* Total review of the stablecoin market and a breakdown by projects.

* Total breakdown of the stablecoin market by blockchains.

* The most attractive stablecoin yields.

* Important events and news from the last month.

* Useful resources for more stablecoin information.

## Total Review of Stablecoin Market and Breakdown by Projects

As of May 13th, the total stablecoin market is $160.14 billion, down by 0.30% from last week. USDT dominance of the entire stablecoin market is 69.05%, compared to 69.14% last week. The pie chart below shows the dominance of Tether relative to other stablecoins with a market cap over $1 billion, i.e., the stables of the first league.

Tether is still 3.5 times bigger than its biggest rival Circle, which now has a current circulation amount of USDC around $32.72 billion, a decrease of 0.56% from last week. Like USDC, all fiat-backed stablecoins in this league lost some market cap. FDUSD lost the most with a 1.40% market cap decrease. Whereas Ethena's USDe and Maker's DAI grew slightly . The table below shows the 7-day change in market cap of the stables in the first league.

Now, let's take a look at the second league, i.e., stablecoins between $100m and $1b. We still have 11 stablecoins in this segment . Their total circulation amount is currently $3.45 billion, an increase of 1.09% from last week. The pie chart below illustrates the market cap distribution between the coins.

We didn't see any flippening last week, meaning every stablecoin in this league is protecting their position from previous week. However, we still saw a few major changes. PayPal's PYUSD grew 12.13%, followed by DOLA's 8.17% growth. On the flip side, we see USDD with a 1.12% decrease, making it the biggest loser of the week. Besides USDD, TUSD and BUSD also closed in the red last week. The table below shows the 7-day change in market cap of the stablecoins in the second league.

## Total Breakdown of Stablecoin Market by Blockchains

Now let's examine the competition among chains to attract more stablecoins. Similar to last week, Ethereum and Tron hold more than 85% of the total stablecoin market.


To analyze the competition, we need to exclude Ethereum and Tron, just like the previous reports. However, I slightly modified our approach.

If you read the second or first report, you would notice we classified chains with more than $100m market cap of stablecoins as B-tier (Ethereum and Tron excluded). From now on, we will investigate them in two pieces:

* **B-tier**will refer to chains having more than $1b market cap of stablecoins.

* **C-tier**will refer to chains having more than $100m market cap of stablecoins.

This modification will help us analyze the chains having around $100m market cap of stablecoins. Now let's start with the B-tier chains. Here is the pie chart:

![image](./images/week3-4.webp)

Here we don't have any flips as well. The most gainer of the week is Avalanche with a 4.13% increase in stablecoin market cap, and the most loser is Solana with a 3.31% decrease in stablecoin market cap. The remaining ones faced relatively small changes such that all of them are less than 0.75%.

The C-tier comes with two flippenings! Firstly, last week Fantom was holding the third position where Blast was the fifth, but this changed due to a 1.89% increase in the stablecoin market on Blast and a 0.70% decrease on Fantom. And the second flip was by Stellar which experienced a 7.2% growth. Though the total stablecoin market cap on Gnosis increased by 1.90%, it wasn't enough to protect its position from Stellar.

Near also experienced notable growth of 6.14%, leading to a $438.8m market cap of stablecoins. Near's growth is particulaty noteworthy because, last week, it also saw a 10.81% increase in stablecoins on itself. Sui reached 4.72% growth in terms of stablecoins which makes it the third most gainer of the week in this tier. More details are in the table below.

## The Most Attractive Stablecoin Yields

Let's take a look at the stablecoins offering the highest APYs. These yields are sourced from DeFiLlama and include all types of yields with over $10 million in TVL. Remember that interactions with contracts carry various risks, including hacks, exploits, impermanent loss, depegging scenarios, etc. Please be aware of these risks before engaging and always DYOR!
