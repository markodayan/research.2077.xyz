Hey hey, stablecoinjoyers! Here is a quick update: From now on, our reviews will include stablecoins with market caps between $30 million and $100 million, as well as blockchains that have total stablecoin market caps between $30 million and $100 million. With this improvement, stablecoins are categorized into three groups and blockchains are four. To prevent misunderstandings, the groups of stablecoins are named "league" and the chains are named "tier." I hope you enjoy this improvement. Let's begin the third post of our weekly stablecoin reports. In this report, you will find:

* Total review of the stablecoin market and a breakdown by projects.

* Total breakdown of the stablecoin market by blockchains.

* The most attractive stablecoin yields.

* Important events and news from the last week.

* Useful resources for more stablecoin information.

## Total Review of Stablecoin Market and Breakdown by Projects

As of May 19th, the total stablecoin market is $161.08 billion, up by 0.66% from last week. USDT's dominance of the entire stablecoin market is 68.99%, compared to 69.05% last week. The pie chart below shows the dominance of Tether relative to other stablecoins with a market cap over $1 billion, i.e., the stables of the first league.

Tether is still 2 times bigger than the remaining market and the first league as well. FDUSD's market cap fell 7.59% last week, the only major stablecoin to see a decline. Ethena's USDe was the biggest gainer with a 6.39% market cap increase. The remaining stablecoins grew between 0.36% and 1.25%. The table below shows the 7-day change in market cap of the stablecoins in the first league.

Now, let's take a look at the second league, i.e., stablecoins between $100M and $1B. The total circulation amount of the second league is currently $3.74B, an increase of 6.00% from last week. The pie chart below illustrates the market cap distribution the stablecoins of this league.

Gemini's GUSD reached almost $197M market cap after minting $111.7M new GUSD on April 16th. That brings GUSD back into the second league. In addition to GUSD's flippening of LUSD, DOLA, crvUSD, and USDP, we saw another flippening last week: BUIDL-FRAX. BlackRock minted $44.25M new BUIDL, corresponding to an 11.56% increase. PayPal's PYUSD grew 8.52%, in addition to its growth a week ago by 12.13%. Overall, the market was green last week, except for BUSD, crvUSD, and LUSD's slight decrease. The table below shows the 7-day change in market cap of the stablecoins in the second league.

Let's explore the third league, i.e., stablecoins between $30M and $100M. In this section, there are 13 stablecoins. The competition here is quite balanced. Here is a pie chart showing how similar the market shares are.

In terms of flippenings, we saw a permutation of MIM, GHO, and USDM last week. Their position changes were: MIM moved from 6th to 9th, GHO from 8th to 6th, and USDM from 9th to 8th. In addition to these flippenings, LISUSD grew by 8.83%, following GHO's 10.82% increase. The biggest loser is USD+, with an 11.40% decrease in total supply. The table below shows the 7-day change in market cap of the stablecoins in the third league.

## Total Breakdown of Stablecoin Market by Blockchains

Now, let's examine the competition among chains to attract more stablecoins. Just like last week, Ethereum and Tron hold more than 85% of the total stablecoin market.

To analyze the competition, we need to exclude Ethereum and Tron, just like in previous reports.

If you read the [last report](https://ethereum2077.substack.com/p/weekly-stablecoin-report-3), you would remember we classified chains with more than $1B market cap of stablecoins as B-tier and chains with more than $100M market cap of stablecoins as C-tier. From now on, we'll examine the chains having between $30M and $100M market cap of stablecoins as D-tier. Now let's start with the B-tier chains. The pie chart is almost the same as last week's, since there were no major changes.

![image](./images/week4-7.webp)

Here, we didn't see big changes; all of them closed the week slightly positive. Optimism was the biggest gainer with a 3.57% increase. The table below shows the 7-day change in market cap of the stablecoins on blockchains in the B-tier.

The C-tier comes with a flippening. Last week, Stellar was holding the seventh position, but after a 15.81% growth, it replaced Kava and became the sixth biggest chain in terms of stablecoins in this tier. The pie chart below illustrates the market cap of the stablecoins on blockchains in the C-tier.

Stellar's growth is followed by Sui's increase of 5.6% and Near's increase of 3.19%. Only Fantom and Gnosis decreased in this tier. The table below shows the 7-day change in market cap of the stablecoins on blockchains in the C-tier.

![image](./images/week4-10.webp)

The D-tier contains 13 blockchains, having a total of $761m in stablecoins. Eleven of them maintained their order, except for Mixin and Metis. Metis lost 3.13% of the stablecoins on it, causing Mixin's flippening.

Here, StarkNet saw the biggest gain with a 17.96% increase. This is followed by Algorand with a 2.01% increase, while the other chains' gains were relatively slight. Mode was the biggest loser with a 6.24% decrease, followed by Metis with a 3.13% decrease. The table below shows the 7-day change in market cap of the stablecoins on blockchains in the D-tier.

## The Most Attractive Stablecoin Yields

Let's take a look at the stablecoins offering the highest APYs. These yields are sourced from DeFiLlama and include all types of yields with over $10 million in TVL. Remember that interactions with contracts carry various risks, including hacks, exploits, impermanent loss, depegging scenarios, etc. Please be aware of these risks before engaging and always DYOR!
