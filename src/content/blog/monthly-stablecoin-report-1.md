Hey hey, stablecoinjoyers! Welcome to the very first post of the monthly stablecoin report! As you may be familiar from the weekly stablecoin report, we categorize stablecoins into three groups and blockchains into four. The groups of stablecoins are named "leagues" and the chains are named "tiers." Let's begin this month's stablecoin report. In this report, you will find:

* Total review of the stablecoin market and a breakdown by projects.

* Total breakdown of the stablecoin market by blockchains.

* The most attractive stablecoin yields.

* Important events and news from the last month.

* Useful resources for more stablecoin information.

As of May 31st, the total stablecoin market is $160.48 billion, an increase of 0.42% compared to May 1st. USDT's dominance of the entire stablecoin market is 69.56%, up from 69.15% last month.

The total market cap of stablecoins with a market cap over $1 billion, i.e., the stables of the first league, is $154.23 billion, down by 0.16% compared to the beginning of May. The dominance of Tether in the first league was over 70% throughout May. The pie chart below shows the dominance of Tether relative to the stables of the first league at the end of May.

In May, Ethena's USDe was the biggest gainer, with a 28.40% market cap increase, corresponding to $662 million in new USDe. The total market cap of USDe reached $2.99 billion. The biggest loser in the first league was FDUSD, which shrank by about 34%, corresponding to a $1.30 billion market cap loss. The total market cap of FDUSD became $2.52 billion. These two major changes caused USDe to overtake FDUSD. Here is the weekly position status of the first league in May. In the position tables, green cells indicate position gainers, whereas red cells indicate position losers.

The other stablecoins in the first league remained more stable compared to USDe and FDUSD. The table below shows the 31-day change in market cap of the stablecoins in the first league.

Now, let's take a look at the second league, i.e., stablecoins with a market cap between $100 million and $1 billion. Last month, significant changes occurred in the second league, bringing the total market cap to $3.97 billion, an increase of 15.77%. The biggest competitor is USDD, followed by TUSD and BUIDL. The pie chart below illustrates the market cap distribution of the stablecoins in this league.

HUSD showed strong performance last month, particularly in the final week. USDB also enhanced its standing in the past two weeks. Below is the weekly overview for the second half of May.

At the beginning of May, HUSD was not in the second league, but it now holds the 8th position with a market cap of $222.6 million, corresponding to a whopping 1336.21% growth. Gemini's GUSD records the other significant movement with a 78.7% increase. Paypal's PYUSD follows GUSD with a 41.1% growth. It's also worth mentioning that USDB and BUIDL showed good performances with 23.4% and 21% increases, respectively. The table below shows the 31-day change in market cap of the stablecoins in the second league.

The market cap change status of this league, i.e., stablecoins with a market cap of between $30 million and $100 million, was generally negative. Eight out of twelve stablecoins in this league lost market cap. As of May 31st, the total market cap of this league is $589.8 million, a 2.05% decrease compared to the beginning of May. The pie chart below illustrates the market cap distribution of the stablecoins in the third league.

The competition in the second league was intense in May. GHO achieved a higher position almost every week. Additionally, USDM, MIM, BEAN, and USD+ competed for positions 6-8 throughout the month.

As of May 31st, GHO has a market cap of $66.3 million, with a gain of $17.4 million. This corresponds to a 35.6% growth compared to the beginning of May. Additionally, LISUSD and BEAN saw 12.6% and 6% growth, respectively. All other stablecoins in this league, excluding BUSD, closed negatively last month in terms of market cap. The biggest market cap loser was SUSD with a 19.37% decrease, followed by MIM and USD+. The table below shows the 31-day change in market cap of the stablecoins in the third league.

Now, let's examine the competition among chains to attract more stablecoins. During May, Ethereum and Tron held more than 85% of total stablecoin issuance. Stablecoin issuance on Ethereum decreased by 1.69%, whereas Tron experienced a growth of 1.63%. As of May 31st, Ethereum's share corresponds to 49.9% of all stablecoins, while Tron's is 35.6%. The pie chart below shows how Ethereum and Tron compare to other chains in holding stablecoins.

To analyze the competition, we need to exclude Ethereum and Tron, just like in the weekly reports.

This tier has $19.73 billion in stablecoins, with a 2.32% increase compared to the previous month. In this tier, there are seven chains competing, with Binance Smart Chain leading the competition. Here is a pie chart of the B-tier chains.

The blockchains in the B-tier mostly protected their ranks in May. However, in the last week, Base flipped Solana and became the third biggest chain in this league in terms of stablecoin issuance.

Last month, Base attracted more than $485 million in new stablecoin issuance, corresponding to an 18.2% growth. The source of this growth is Circle's USDC.

Additionally, Optimism gained a notable stablecoin market cap with a 6.43% increase in total stablecoin issuance. Polygon and Arbitrum's total stablecoin issuance also increased in May. The biggest stablecoin loser of the month was Solana, with a 6.52% decrease due to the loss of $200 million in USDC market cap. The table below shows the 31-day change in market cap of the stablecoins on blockchains in the B-tier.

The C-tier experienced massive growth of 24.6%. As of May 31st, the total stablecoin issuance in the C-tier is $2.318 billion, up from $1.860 billion at the beginning of the month. Currently, the biggest share of this tier belongs to Near, followed closely by Blast and Sui. The pie chart below illustrates the market cap of the stablecoins on blockchains in the C-tier.

Aptos joined the competition in this chain last week. It's not wrong to say that Near, Blast, and Sui competed for the top position throughout the month. In addition to those, there was also intense competition among Kava, Stellar, and Gnosis.

In the competition table above, it seems Fantom lost some positions; however, this is not due to a loss in market cap of stablecoins in May. In fact, all the chains in the C-tier saw growth last month. The biggest growth belonged to Blast, with a 14.84% increase, giving it a stablecoin market cap of over $420 million. The table below shows the 31-day change in market cap of the stablecoins on blockchains in the C-tier.

Let's investigate the D-tier now. At the beginning of May, there were 14 chains in this tier, and as of May 31st, there are 12. The two missing chains are Aptos and Kava; both have been listed in the C-tier since they exceeded $100 million in stablecoin issuance. The total stablecoin issuance in the D-tier increased by 3.1%, reaching $696 million. Note that since Aptos and Kava are no longer in this tier, these values do not include them. The pie chart below shows the competition among chains in the D-tier.

In terms of ranks, we haven't seen major changes in the D-tier during May. In the column for last week, there are seven green cells; however, six of them gained positions due to Aptos leaving the tier. Apart from this, only Heco moved up the table.

Nine out of twelve chains in this tier lost market cap last month. However, due to Heco's growth of 63.6%, the overall market cap of this tier is positive. Additionally, Starknet saw notable growth, with a 22.1% increase in stablecoins. On the loss side, the biggest decrease belongs to Mode, with a 31.2% drop. The table below shows the 31-day change in market cap of the stablecoins on blockchains in the D-tier.

Let's take a look at the stablecoins offering the highest APYs. These yields are sourced from DeFiLlama and include all types of yields with over $10 million in TVL. Remember that interactions with contracts carry various risks, including hacks, exploits, impermanent loss, depegging scenarios, etc. Please be aware of these risks before engaging and always DYOR!
